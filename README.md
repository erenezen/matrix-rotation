# Matrix Rotation

This project performs matrix transposition and 90-degree rotation on a matrix using the PicoBlaze microprocessor. The matrix is stored in scratchpad memory and manipulated using low-level assembly instructions.

## Requirements
- **FiDEx IDE** is required to assemble and run the `.psm` file.

## Usage (FiDEx IDE)
1. Open **FiDEx IDE**.
2. Load the `.psm` file into the editor.
3. Assemble the code using the **"Assemble"** button.
4. Run the program using the **"Simulate"** option.
5. Observe the output in the **scratchpad memory**.

## Note
- This project is designed specifically for **PicoBlaze** architecture and may not be directly compatible with other environments.
