# Matrix Rotation 

This project performs matrix transposition and 90-degree rotation on a matrix using the PicoBlaze microprocessor. The matrix is stored in scratchpad memory and manipulated using low-level assembly instructions.

## Requirements
- **FiDEx IDE** is required to assemble and run the `.psm` file.

## Note
- This project is designed specifically for **PicoBlaze** architecture and may not be directly compatible with other environments.
