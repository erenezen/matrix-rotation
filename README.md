# matrix-rotation

This project performs matrix transposition and 90-degree rotation on a matrix using the PicoBlaze microprocessor. The matrix is stored in scratchpad memory and manipulated using low-level assembly-like instructions.

Features:
-Transposes a square matrix.
-Rotates the matrix 90 degrees clockwise.
-Uses PicoBlaze architecture for execution.
